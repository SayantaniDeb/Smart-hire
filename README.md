### ðŸ¤– Smart Team Builder
The app can build teams for you automatically:
- Follows your search filters (like "only senior developers")
- Picks people from different backgrounds and locations
- Shows you how diverse your team is
- Tells you when you get a great mix of people

### ðŸ“Š Team Diversity Score
- **Live updates**: See your diversity score change as you pick people
- **Three main areas**: Different job roles (40%), different locations (35%), different experience levels (25%)
- **Notifications**: Get alerts when your team gets more diverse

### ðŸ’¾ Save Your Work
Download your team info including:
- Who you picked and their details
- How diverse your team is
- What filters you used
- Salary information
- When you made your choices

## How to get started

### What you need
- Node.js (version 18 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash
# Download the code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-hire.git

# Go to the folder
cd Smart-hire

# Install what you need
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`



### Basic steps

1. **Look at candidates**: See everyone available with their scores
2. **Use filters**: Narrow down who you see based on what you need
3. **Pick manually**: Click on people to add them to your favorites or team
4. **Use auto-pick**: Let the app build a diverse team for you
5. **Save your team**: Download information about who you chose

### Smart team building

The auto-pick feature respects your filters:

- **No filters**: Picks from everyone to get the most diverse team
- **Experience filter** (like "Entry Level"): Only picks beginners but makes sure they're from different places and job types
- **Job filter** (like "Backend"): Only picks backend developers but gets different experience levels and locations
- **Multiple filters**: Combines all your requirements while making the most diverse team possible

### How diversity scoring works

The app looks at three things to measure diversity:

- **Job types**: Frontend, Backend, Design, etc. (counts for 40%)
- **Locations**: Where people are from (counts for 35%)
- **Experience**: Junior, Mid-level, Senior (counts for 25%)

You get 100% diversity when you have:
- 5 different job types
- 5 different locations  
- 4 different experience levels

## Technical stuff

### How it manages data
Uses React Context to keep track of:
- Filtering and scoring candidates
- Your team picks and favorites
- Which view you're looking at

### Mobile-friendly design

### Performance
